BMX Trade, formerly known as Morpheus Swap, is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that facilitates trading of cryptocurrencies and onchain media, including NFTs, with a focus on capital efficiency and protocol rewards. Backed by Coinbase Ventures, BMX Trade leverages Base’s low-cost, scalable infrastructure to offer spot trading, perpetual futures with up to 60x leverage, and liquidity provision through its native token, BLT (Base Liquidity Token). The platform’s innovative design eliminates competition between trading liquidity (BLT) and native-protocol liquidity, ensuring deep liquidity and low fees.

BMX Trade operates two main interfaces:BMX Classic: Supports spot and perpetual trading with up to 50x leverage, featuring zero price impact swaps.

BMX Freestyle: A derivatives DEX with intent-based trading powered by SYMMIO, offering over 250 markets and up to 60x leverage.

Additionally, BMX Trade includes Based MediaX, a gas-free NFT marketplace, and BMX Analytics for performance tracking, making it a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem.
